<h1>Face Generation using ProGAN</h1>

You can run all this locally (even if you don't have a GPU)!  

<h2>TEST THE CRITIC</h2>

"generated_images/" contains 20 images generated by various trained models.  
1) 8x8 grids
2) images of single faces

The images in "generated_images/1x1" can be used to test the critic network.  

Run this in the "ProGAN" directory:  
1) Score one random image in "generated_images/1x1/" using trained model "deep-critic-128x128.pth".  
    `python score_image.py`


<h2>TEST THE GENERATOR</h2>

Run this in the "ProGAN" directory:
1) Generate a grid of 64 images using trained model "deep-generator-128x128.pth".  
    `python generate_images.py`

2) Generate one image using trained model "deep-generator-128x128.pth".
    `python generate_images.py --grid_size=1`


<h2>HOW TO USE SCRIPTS</h2>

Run this.  
    `./scripts/./test-ProGAN-howto.sh`

Will show you how to use scripts. Below are the contents of the HOWTO script file:
    
        To SCORE an image: ./scripts/./score_images.sh <model_file_name> <image_path> <num_runs>
        Called by script <num_runs> times: python score_image.py --model_file_name=<model_file_name> --image_path=<image_path>

        To GENERATE images: ./scripts/./generate_images.sh <model_file_name> <grid_size> <num_runs>
        Called by script <num_runs> times: python generate_images.py --model_file_name=<model_file_name> --grid_size=<grid_size>

<h3>Example commands with scripts.</h3>

1) Score one random image in "generated_images/1x1/" using trained model "deep-critic-128x128.pth".  
    `./scripts/./score_images.sh deep-critic-128x128.pth random 1`

2) Score five random images in "generated_images/".  
    `./scripts/./score_images.sh deep-critic-128x128.pth random 5`

3) Generate one grid of 64 images using the trained model "deep-generator-128x128.pth".  
    `./scripts/./generate_images.sh deep-generator-128x128.pth 64 1`

3) Generate 1 image using the trained model "deep-generator-128x128.pth".  
    `./scripts/./generate_images.sh deep-generator-128x128.pth 1 1`
